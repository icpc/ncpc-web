Join the Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC) and test your skills in competitive programming! Whether you're looking to become the Nordic Champion or just want to have fun solving engaging problems, NCPC is the perfect platform for you.

We suggest that you check out the [problems from last year's NCPC](https://ncpc22.kattis.com/problems). For even more practice, visit [https://open.kattis.com/](https://open.kattis.com/) featuring thousands of problems of various difficulty.

If your university is not listed - contact your computer science department or programming society, and ask if they would like to host a local site. It's also usually possible to compete at a nearby university's site. Interested in hosting a site? Have a look at the [site page](/ncpc2024/sites).
