  <h3>Site Director</h3>
</div>
Each NCPC contest site is managed by a designated site director. The site director is responsible for ensuring a smooth and successful contest experience, and is encouraged to enlist the assistance of local volunteers.

Each site should meet the following conditions:

- Teams should be seated in a designated area, with one table per team and ample space between teams.
- Each team should have easy access to a power outlet for their computer.
- Each team should receive 3 printed copies of the problem statements in a sealed envelope in the minutes before the contest, which they may open once the contest starts.

Site directors are in communication with the NCPC organizers through the NCPC discord server. To join and stay up-to-date on important information, follow the link: [{{site.discord_link}}]({{site.discord_link}})
