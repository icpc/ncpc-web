# Call for problems

<br>

We are seeking you problem ideas for NCPC 2025!

You can submit problems in two ways:

1. By e-mailing a problem idea to head of jury Nils Gustafsson <[nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se](mailto:nils.gustafsson@kodsport.se)> no later than Sunday, July 20 2025.
2. By submitting a problem to NWERC and marking it as a simultaneous submission to NCPC. Further instructions will appear at [https://2025.nwerc.eu/](https://2025.nwerc.eu/) shortly.

If you go for option 1, the following instructions apply. A problem proposal should consist of a draft of a problem statement (simple text file is fine), as well as a short description of the intended solution. Test data and a sample solution is appreciated, but not required. It should be possible to implement the intended solution with at most a few hundred lines of code and it should not take more than a couple of seconds to run. See [https://nordic.icpc.io/archive](/archive) for previous years' problems.

Note that if you submit a problem and it's selected you can not participate in NCPC.

Communication regarding the problem selection and later problem preparation is handled through a mailing list, which you will be added to if you propose a problem.
